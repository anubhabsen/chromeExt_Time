Chrome Extension
================

Use the [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/je7al576kkmqb1t/getDate.crx?raw=1) to download the extension. Drag the file into the chrome extensions page (_chrome://extensions_) to install.

This is my first attempt at making a chrome extension. It's a simple extension which displays the current date in dd/mm/yyyy format. There is no styling as of yet. Improvements: styling, possibly time coming soon.

Any suggestions, contribution welcome :)
